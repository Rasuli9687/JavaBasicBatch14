Arrays:
	arrays are consecutive memory locations which store
	same type of date
why we need arrays?
Arrays help us store large amounts of data in a single
variable. for example if we want to store the names of 
100 students we dont need to create 100 variables we can simple
create an array of size 100 and it will store the names.
Syntax(how to use):
	Data type[] name of array=new data type [size]
